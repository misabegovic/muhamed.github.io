Been thinking about the "bring your own agent" idea and how it could apply to [Usput.ba](https://usput.ba).

The future of human communication feels less like app-to-human and more like **agent-to-agent**: you have your own AI that handles the tedious parts — asking questions, comparing options, negotiating, rescheduling. Why shouldn't travel work the same way?

For Usput.ba, that means exposing the platform through an **MCP server** so agents on both sides of a trip can talk to our Platform agent directly. The agents ask, plan, and negotiate; the humans just approve the final proposal.

This isn't limited to travelers connecting their personal agents. Anyone offering something to a traveler can plug one in too:

- **Hotels, guesthouses, and apartments** — availability, pricing, special requests, check-in details.
- **Restaurants, cafés, and bars** — reservations, dietary options, group menus, opening hours.
- **Tour guides and activity operators** — custom tours, group sizes, gear, weather contingencies.
- **Transfer and rental services** — pickups, routes, vehicle types.
- **Travel agencies, DMCs, and concierges** — packaged itineraries, negotiated rates, bundled services.
- **Individuals** renting a room, offering a cooking class, or guiding a hike.

The Platform agent becomes a matchmaker between demand-side agents (travelers) and supply-side agents (providers). Instead of a traveler browsing a site, you get agent-to-agent negotiation across the whole ecosystem.

What changes:

- **Travelers** can plan in natural language across destinations, experiences, and constraints ("4 days in October, family with a toddler, wheelchair accessible").
- **Preferences** that search forms suck at — "quiet mountain towns with good coffee," "no crowds," "pet-friendly" — become queryable because an agent can iterate.
- **Cross-service trips** get easier: the agent combines Usput.ba data with flights, weather, calendar, and hotels in one conversation.
- **Custom deals** like "private Una rafting for 8 people on July 14th" can be negotiated agent-to-agent before a human sees the final offer.
- **Providers** spend less time answering repeat questions and more time hosting.
- **Travel agencies and DMCs** can assemble complex, multi-provider itineraries without manual coordination.
- **Usput.ba** becomes the canonical coordination layer for Bosnian tourism; generic travel AIs ground themselves here instead of hallucinating.

The smallest safe step is a read-only MCP for travelers. Agent-to-agent negotiation and provider-facing agents come later.
